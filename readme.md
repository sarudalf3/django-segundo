# Django First steps - Time Display

In this exercise I displayed the time and date using different tools.

The App name is TimeApp.

- In /root/ you'll figure out the static time and date using Python functions.
- In /root/time_display/ you'll figure out the same, but the HTML template was created using css and bootstrap tools.
- In /root/time_actual/ you'll find the actual hour, changing every second using jQuery tools.
